# Project Report

## Project Name: A Comprehensive Analysis On Weather Conditions And  Solar Power Production
### Project Description:
Through this project, we did perform a comprehensive analysis on a weather-solar dataset. We did perform a statistical analysis and data visualization to uncover the patterns and trends between weather conditions and solar power production by creating a uni-variate and bi-variate analysis.

## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to present valuable insights and recommendations that could help solar systems installation companies improve its processes.

## The top 10 valuable insights extracted are :

1. Solar energy production is directly linked to Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI): As GHI increases, so does the energy production. This highlights the importance of sunlight for solar power generation.

2. Energy production tends to be highest around midday: This is likely due to higher solar radiation during these hours.

3. Energy production varies throughout the year: It is highest during the summer months (between May and August) and lowest during winter. This can possibly be due to seasonal weather changes.

4. Clear weather leads to greater energy production, while harsh weather conditions contribute to lower energy production. On average, clear weather (weather_type = 1) contributes to higher energy generation, followed by partially cloudy (weather_type = 2) and cloudy weather (weather_type = 4). Rainy and snowy weather (weather_type = 3 and 5) show the least energy production, as expected.

5. Higher temperatures can decrease the efficiency of solar panels, leading to lower energy output.

6. Other environmental factors, such as pressure, humidity, and wind speed, also influence energy production.

7. More cloud cover contributes to a decrease in energy production.

8. Increased day length does not necessarily translate to increased energy production. The sunlight hours are more crucial to energy production than the total length of the day.

9. The hour of the day also shows a nuanced impact on energy production, possibly due to changing conditions throughout the day.

10. The relationship between weather parameters and renewable energy generation is complex and multidimensional.
