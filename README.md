# Project Report

## Project Name: A Comprehensive Analysis On Weather Conditions And  Solar Power Production
### Project Description:
Through this project, we did perform a comprehensive analysis on a weather-solar dataset. We did perform a statistical analysis and data visualization to uncover the patterns and trends between weather conditions and solar power production by creating a uni-variate and bi-variate analysis.

## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to present valuable insights and recommendations that could help solar systems installation companies improve its processes.

## The top 10 valuable insights extracted are :

1. Solar energy production is directly linked to Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI): As GHI increases, so does the energy production. This highlights the importance of sunlight for solar power generation.
